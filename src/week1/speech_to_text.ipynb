In presenting this work for the first time in English dress, the translator would take the opportunity of drawing the attention of the devout American reader to one or two peculiarities in its structure, which have already won for it a wide recognition among readers of books of its class in Europe. In the first place, the allotment of separate months to individual virtues agrees well with the practice of self-examination much recommended by many spiritual writers, who advise us to take different virtues in turn as the object of special effort. Nothing certainly could be better fitted to assist us in the acquisition of a virtue than these selections from the writings of the most eminent masters of spiritual science, which portray its beauties, declare its necessity, or explain its various degree and the methods of its attainment. In the second place, the few words of exhortation or instruction which open the reading for each day are followed by the best of all commentaries, that of action.

      "summary: The translator of the book \"A Year with the Saints\" acknowledges certain peculiarities in its structure that have gained recognition among readers in Europe. Firstly, the book assigns separate virtues to each month, aligning with the practice of self-examination recommended by spiritual writers. This approach helps readers focus on a specific virtue and learn about its significance and how to attain it through selections from the writings of esteemed spiritual masters. Secondly, the book provides a brief exhortation or instruction for each day followed by numerous examples that serve as real-life commentaries, demonstrating that the precepts and principles of spiritual life can be applied in everyday situations. The translator hopes that this book will inspire readers in America to cultivate spiritual excellence and beauty in their lives.\n"
